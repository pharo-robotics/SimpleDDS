For starting up this examples you should have one remote domain descriptor. SimpleDDS is ROS master compatible then the options you have are: 
	
	- Start a ros master (roscore command)  and modify the example according your configuration (ip:port) 
	- Open a new image and execute a Domain descriptor example from the DDSSettingUpDomainExamples
	- Use the subclass example for using the hybrid domain definition
